# Computer Organization (CS61C 2015 spring)
**I use repositories on github to store my project code of open courses. I have to refer to many resources, including some existing code, since I study computer science by myself. I will list the main resources here:**

+ https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/ (course site)
+ https://github.com/cs61c-spring2015 (starter code)
+ https://github.com/Junren0716/CS61c (work by a UCB student, thank you so much!)
